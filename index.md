<p align=center>I am very interested in combining my data analysis skills with my passion for the creative arts. My experience with software and data engineering includes a 2 year rotational program through John Hancock, where I first worked as a full stack engineer, and eventually took on more leadership through facilitating daily production support meetings and collaborating with business analysts on client requests. I then transitioned to a role within the data team, where I analyzed data mappings and used data visualization tools to better portray the data. This experience sparked my interest in data, prompting me to deepen my knowledge of machine learning and data analysis tools. I still have much to learn, but am enthusiastic and always looking for self improvement. Beyond my technical expertise I have hands-on experience in the music industry. I play several instruments myself, and have learned more everyday working for a local performance venue in my neighborhood. I have learned so much through this role, and love to learn more everyday. **Find out more on my resume</p>

### Data Projects 


[Choose Your Own Adventure Chatbot](/sample_page)

For this project, I create a "Choose Your Own Adventure" chabot through openrouter API with the mistrel 7b model: a model which free for use and compatible with ChatGPTs OpenAI package. The chatbot assumes the role of a DND dungeon master that sets up an environment and creates a story that develops based on user interative choices!

[Natural Language Processing Chatbot](/sample2_page)

This project focuses primarily on NLP concept, using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Tensorflow, and Keras API to prepare and train a chatbot to understand basic English language phrases such as greetings, goodbyes, and pleasantries. These phrases are stored in a json file, then the code tokenizes each sentence so they are broken up into their core words. Following tokenization, each word is formatted to be lowercase, and then lemmatized - that is, to be shortened to its root form. Finally, a Stocahstic Gradient Descent model with 3 layers is compiled and fitted to train the data over 200 epochs. After each epoch cycle, accuracy and loss of the cycle are recorded.

[Kaggle Competition: Housing Prices](/sample3_page)

Kaggle is a data science platform that hosts machine learning competitions for its online community. This particular machine learning competition gives the user a dataset of houses and their respective prices, and requires that the user build a model to accurately predict the sale price of houses in a new dataset. For my predictions, I use a Random Forest classifier model, which is a model that takes the mean value of multiple Decision Trees. I used this model, along with specific features chosen based on which feature combination would provide the lowest mean absolute error with the validation data.
