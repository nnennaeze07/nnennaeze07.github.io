<p align=center>The opportunity to combine my data analysis skills with my passion for the creative arts is a huge goal of mine. My experience with software and data engineering includes a 2 year rotational program through John Hancock, working as a full stack engineer, and eventually taking on more leadership through facilitating daily production support meetings and collaborating with business analysts on client requests. My second year I transitioned to a role within the data management team, where I analyzed Informatica mappings and used visualization tools to better portray the data. Since then, I have been inspired to deepen my knowledge of machine learning and analytical software. There is always more to learn, and I am enthusiastic and always looking for new experiences. Beyond my technical expertise I have hands-on experience in the music industry. I play several instruments myself, and currently work as a sound engineer for a Boston based performance venue. This opportunity has allowed me to work with many musicians of different genres and calibers, as well as improve my recordinig and mixing skills. I am very eager for more music and data opportunity. **Find out more on my resume</p>

### Data Projects 

[Sample Sales Data Report](/sample4_page)

This project is a mock data analysis report for a health worker staffing company that focuses on long term care facilities. It contains several recommendations for a sales and marketing team regarding focus areas that may increase sales for the company and broaden their customer reach. The recommendations in the report are supported using several graphs and charts (created using Tableau) to make the data readable and more digestible to the viewer. The data used was taken from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, a federal agency. 

[Choose Your Own Adventure Chatbot](/sample_page)

For this project, I create a "Choose Your Own Adventure" chabot through openrouter API with the mistrel 7b model: a model which free for use and compatible with ChatGPTs OpenAI package. The chatbot assumes the role of a DND dungeon master that sets up an environment and creates a story that develops based on user interative choices!

[Natural Language Processing Chatbot](/sample2_page)

This project focuses primarily on NLP concept, using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Tensorflow, and Keras API to prepare and train a chatbot to understand basic English language phrases such as greetings, goodbyes, and pleasantries. These phrases are stored in a json file, then the code tokenizes each sentence so they are broken up into their core words. Following tokenization, each word is formatted to be lowercase, and then lemmatized - that is, to be shortened to its root form. Finally, a Stocahstic Gradient Descent model with 3 layers is compiled and fitted to train the data over 200 epochs. After each epoch cycle, accuracy and loss of the cycle are recorded.

[Kaggle Competition: Housing Prices](/sample3_page)

Kaggle is a data science platform that hosts machine learning competitions for its online community. This particular machine learning competition gives the user a dataset of houses and their respective prices, and requires that the user build a model to accurately predict the sale price of houses in a new dataset. For my predictions, I use a Random Forest classifier model, which is a model that takes the mean value of multiple Decision Trees. I used this model, along with specific features chosen based on which feature combination would provide the lowest mean absolute error with the validation data.

  <p>A few examples of my recording and mixing experience: all tracks above were recorded and mixed by me (Nnenna Eze). Mixed use of Allen & Heath QU-16 Sound Mixer, Reaper DAW, and home hardware. When recording live performances I opted not to use pitch correction to keep the authenticity of the performance. </p>
